# php_printer
php_printer.dll library for Windows builds of PHP

Currently only supported on 5.6.35. PHP 7+ has a different zend engine and requires the source to be rewritten. If anyone can assist me with this i've included the source for 5.6.35 here.

As and when I can build newer versions i'll share them back to the community on here. Some peoples repo's don't allow the sharing of these back, so having to create my own repo for them.

Please note: Use these at your own risk. I offer no warranties or guarantees that these are bug free, but I have tested these in our environment without any issues.

I used the guide at: https://community.apachefriends.org/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=70797 in order to build these libraries.
