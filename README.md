# php_printer
php_printer library for Windows builds of PHP

This repo is for continued builds of the no longer supported php_printer library.

I'm building newer versions of these libraries as and when I need them and sharing them back to the community. Some peoples repo's don;t allow the sharing of these back, so having to create my own repo for them.
Please note: Use at your own risk, but I have tested these in our production environment without any issues.

I used the guide at: https://community.apachefriends.org/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=70797 in order to build these libraries
